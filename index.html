Repo name: boolean-uk-html-gymtastic

Description
Using everything we've learned so far about the Box Model

Instructions
- Replicate the website in the screenshot

Tips
- Think about the hierarchy of the page, start by creating elements for each section, then work your way through each section until you're happy with how it looks
- Use divs for containers where appropriate
- Give your elements readable classes to easily identify and style them
- If you have multiple of something, it's probably a list. You can always style the list to your liking though!

Challenge
Time to get creative
Add a testimonial section after the follow us part!

Challenge  2
Add a second page that link to the about us, and has the same layout and styling 
In this page add the about information, and after create a section that has a row of cards with different gym locations -->
    <h1>
      This is a static template, there is no bundler or bundling involved!
    </h1>
  </body>
</html>
